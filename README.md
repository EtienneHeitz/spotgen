Examples
--------

-   [Pitchfork's 50 Best Albums of 2016](examples/pitchfork-50-best-albums-of-2016.spotify.txt) ([source](examples/pitchfork-50-best-albums-of-2016.txt))
-   [Pitchfork's 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time](examples/pitchfork-50-best-ambient-albums-of-all-time.spotify.txt) ([source](examples/pitchfork-50-best-ambient-albums-of-all-time.txt))

Obtain
------

The source code is located at [GitHub](https://github.com/epsil/spotify-js). To clone the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/epsil/spotify-js.git

Alternatively, download a [ZIP file](https://github.com/epsil/spotify-js/archive/master.zip).

Usage
-----

    $ ./spotify.js input.txt output.txt

`input.txt`:

    Walk in the Park - Beach House
    Irene - Beach House
    Other People - Beach House
    Troublemaker - Beach House
    Wishes - Beach House

`output.txt`:

    spotify:track:4oNXgGnumnu5oIXXyP8StH
    spotify:track:7rAjeWkQM6cLqbPjZtXxl2
    spotify:track:2Nt4Uw91pQLXSJ28SttDdF
    spotify:track:4qbCRlvE5Bb9XNBjxARjoP
    spotify:track:7x4tFmih1JBITx0e2ucGrT

To import the playlist, copy the contents of `output.txt` to the clipboard, create a new playlist in Spotify, and paste into it (with *Edit -> Paste* or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>).

### GUI alternatives

Although a command-line script is unsurpassably efficient for processing multiple playlists in batch, a GUI may be simpler to use if one only has a few playlists to import. Here are a couple of free web services:
